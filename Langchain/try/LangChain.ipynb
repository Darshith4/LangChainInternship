However, there are not many comprehensive apps that would notify/guide users in real-time in a multitude of scenarios. Several commuters spend a lot of time not only in commuting, but also in waiting for their rides. An information system that would inform and alert users on delays in real-time and on alternative routes in a pro-active manner would be very helpful in saving precious time. The app should work in tandem with a centralized information system that would continuously update and communicate schedules and delays (if any) in real- time. The app can be a constant companion to commuters and alert them/guide them with short and user-friendly messages or through any other user-friendly mode, on any commuter- related activity. The app should not only address the routine functionality and challenges associated with commuting, but also the other major challenges and solutions as you see it. Google may also display alternative routes based on several factors, however this app is meant to learn from user behavior on an ongoing basis in majorly customizing and alerting the user on alternative routes and options in a pro-active manner. Instructions  You need to define the Software Requirements Specification for the proposed App using the (FURPS+) framework that includes the specification for:  o Supportability Requirements o Design, Implementation, External Hardware and Physical Constraints  A minimum of 9 and a maximum of 12 most important requirements may be included for each category.\"\n",
